The real problem (and what I’d fix)
What is problematic is that app initialization is blocked waiting for a user response even during the lockout window, and the UI forces the user to wait and prevents pre-typing.
You’ve got two good options (pick based on desired UX):
Option A (recommended): backend waits out the cooldown before prompting
If cooldown is active, don’t call customPasswordPrompt yet.
Instead: show a status (“Too many attempts, waiting 4:37…”) and await sleep(remainingSeconds); then prompt normally.
Pros
No “disabled password dialog” while locked.
Backend isn’t stuck awaiting a renderer response during lockout.
Clearer separation: cooldown is a state, password prompt is an action.
Cons
Slightly more backend logic.
Option B: keep prompt visible but allow typing during cooldown (submit still disabled)
Change UI so the password input is enabled during cooldown, but the submit button remains disabled until timer hits 0.
Pros
Minimal backend changes.
Better UX: user can paste/type while waiting; at 0 they just hit submit.
Still secure: brute force is still blocked by submit lockout.
Cons
Still “startup blocked” (by design) until the user submits; but at least it feels responsive.
